# nkd-vis
This library is designed to be _very_ simple - it's a hack instead of a library :-), based on the following idea. 

1. Fetch your spec from the Vega examples gallery. 
1. Parse it using your favourite json library.
1. Replace the parts you want by noodling around with the JSON
1. Pipe the spec out to a temporary file and open it in the browser
